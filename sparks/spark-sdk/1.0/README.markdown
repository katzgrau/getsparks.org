# CodeIgniter Spark Development Kit

This is a spark that will assist in developing other sparks. Most notably, it will
provide spark developers with a tool the sparks they've written before they're
submitted to getsparks.org.

It is the exact library used on the server side to decide whether your spark
passes or fails inspection when it's submitted. Previously, spark developers
would just get an annoying email telling them what's up.
